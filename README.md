Version 1.0.0 [PR UL](https://github.com/idcargill/automation/compare/dev?expand=1)


## Overview

Given a document potential-contacts, find and collect all email addresses and phone numbers.

## Getting Started
First started with implementation of Regex for filtering phone numbers and emails to show the appropriate formatting. Had to import and install poetry and other dependnecies to getting code base structured. Used VS-Code live share to mob code lab with otthers to formulate a code base that incorparated everyone's conrtibutions. Went through trial and error with peer reviewing of each other's code, we were able to then make a final version that met all the criteria for the problem Domain.  

### Lab 19

This lab required us to create:

1. Phone numbers may be in various formats.
(xxx) yyy-zzzz, yyy-zzzz, xxx-yyy-zzzz, etc.
-phone numbers with missing area code should presume 206

-phone numbers should be stored in xxx-yyy-zzzz format.

2.Once emails and phone numbers are found they should be stored in two separate documents.

3.The information should be sorted in ascending order.
*note*Duplicate entries are not allowed.
